# Purpose: This script is designed to create a lockbox for a given user and store it in
#          a database. The lockbox is a collection of encrypted notes that can be
#          accessed by the user.
#          This script uses the cryptography library to encrypt and decrypt notes.
#          It also uses the sqlite3 library to interact with the database.
#          The database is a simple key-value store where the key is the user's ID
#          and the value is the encrypted lockbox.
